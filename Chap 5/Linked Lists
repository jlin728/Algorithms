function ListNode(value)

{

this.val = value;

this.next = null; }

List: Add Front

Rudy isn’t nice: he cuts in line in front of everyone else. Given a pointer to the first ListNode and a value, create a new node, assign it to the list head, and return a pointer to the new head node.

List: Contains

Sam thinks Tad might be somewhere in a very long line waiting to attend the Superman movie. Given a ListNode pointer and a val, return whether val is found in any node in the list.

List: Remove Front

Ha! Rudy is getting what he deserves – kicked out of line. Given a pointer to the first node in a list, remove the head node and return the new list head node. If list is empty, return null .
