Debugging Your JavaScript Code

There are various ways to test and debug JavaScript code using artificial environments such as JSBin or plugins for your code editor. However, we prefer the real-world JS environment that truly matters: browsers. This way you test your code in a way that doesn’t emulate the real-world: it is the real-world environment. Here are steps for one workflow that uses both editor and browser when creating/testing:

1) Go to Sublime/Atom, create a new file with the HTML file extension, and save it.

2) Within that file, type html and hit [tab]. Sublime will create the basic html tags for you.

3) Within the <head> section, type script and again hit [tab], to create <script> tags. You can delete the other attributes inside the <script> tag, as well as the <style> and even <body> tags; you don’t need those if all you are doing is writing/testing JavaScript.

4) As the very first line after the <script> tag, always include "use strict"; .

5) Now write JS code as you wish. Remember to save as you go, of course.

6) When you are ready to test your code (which should be early and often), right-click on the Sublime file and select “Open in Browser”.

7) Your default browser will open a window. We prefer Chrome for testing JS, but any browser is fine. Within that window, open the Developer Console (the MacOS key sequence is cmd-opt-J ​).

8) Type JS into the console such as returnGreaterThanSecond([1,3,5,7,9,11,15]) or var arr=[];returnGreaterThanSecond(arr) or printOdds() to exercise your code.

9) To change or add to your code, cmd-tab back to Sublime/Atom, make your change, then Save.

10) Switch back to browser and Refresh, returning to step 8. You will soon memorize the quick-key sequence for saving in Sublime, returning to browser, and refreshing (cmd s, cmd-tab, cmd-r).

Ultimately, your JavaScript code will run in the browser JS runtime environment, rather than an artificial environment such as JSBin. They produce slightly different results sometimes, so why bother….
